Power BI Project: Budget Insights and Performance Analytics (BIPA)

Project Overview
- Designed and developed an interactive Power BI report to analyze sales performance, integrating data from SQL Server.
- Analyzed sales data from various tables (accounts, campaigns, cases, contacts, industries, opportunities, owners, products, and territories) to provide insights on budget allocation and performance.

Data Import and Preparation
- Imported data from flat files into Power BI.
- Transformed data to resolve data type inconsistencies (INR TO USD).
- Ensured data quality and integrity.

Data Modeling
- Designed a star schema model to optimize data relationships and query performance.
- Avoided many-to-many relationships to maintain data consistency.

Data Visualization and Analysis
- Created interactive dashboards using Power BI to showcase key metrics and insights.
- Utilized various charts and tables, including bar charts, funnels, gauges, and tables.
- Implemented conditional formatting and dynamic filtering to enhance visual effectiveness and performance.

DAX Functions
Tree Map: Number of employees by region.
Table:
Product name by Budget on date onwards 2021.
List of campaigns named by budget with ranking (DAX: Rankx, ALLSELECT).
Budget on Product category in % (DAX: SUM, CALCULATE, ALL).
Show average value on Product category on Budget (DAX: IF, SUM).
Card:
MTD, QTD, YTD-Budget (DAX: TOTALMTD, TOTALQTD, TOTALYTD).
Past 3 months budget and respectively others (DAX: CALCULATE, DATESINPERIOD, LASTN).
Gauge: Prediction on budget like 10% or 20%.
Funnel: Total Budget on won category (DAX: CALCULATE, DATESINPERIOD, LASTN).
Bar Chart: Budget on Product with color formatting - red green (DAX: IF, SUM).
Table:
Top 1 Account owner on the basis of number of employees.
Top 1 Agent on the basis of Resolution in minutes.

Customization and Formatting
Customized reports to enhance readability and user experience.
Applied conditional formatting and dynamic filtering to improve visual effectiveness and performance.
